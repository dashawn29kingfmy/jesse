### Strategy Code Example:  

Here‚Äôs an example of a simple moving average crossover strategy written in Jesse:  

```python
class SMACrossover(Strategy):
    @property
    def slow_sma(self):
        return ta.sma(self.candles, 200)

    @property
    def fast_sma(self):
        return ta.sma(self.candles, 50)

    def should_long(self) -> bool:
        return self.fast_sma > self.slow_sma

    def should_short(self) -> bool:
        return self.fast_sma < self.slow_sma

    def should_cancel_entry(self) -> bool:
        return False

    def go_long(self):
        qty = utils.size_to_qty(self.balance, self.price, fee_rate=self.fee_rate)
        self.buy = qty, self.price

    def go_short(self):
        qty = utils.size_to_qty(self.balance, self.price, fee_rate=self.fee_rate)
        self.sell = qty, self.price

    def update_position(self):
        if self.is_long and self.fast_sma < self.slow_sma:
            self.liquidate()
        if self.is_short and self.fast_sma > self.slow_sma:
